Here's some first usages of my python practice.

A few initial ideas are below. I am open to any feedback or changes.

## Tracking Pokemon and Exporting for Calc

    Tracking Soul linked pokemon: after every route, the bot asks us what route it is, what we nicknamed, any natures or relevant information, and storing this to give back later. Ex. "Helena" parished on a gym battle, the bot marks the three pokemon assigned as Helena as released.

## Giving Back Helpful Data
    - Easier prompting for cheats: depending on the run, cheats are common to make for an easier experience. 
    - You can give the bot the question to grab a specific item or TM/HM and it will spit out the code necessary.

## Run Tracker
  The ability to give out a short, listed summary of what tasks are next. 
  In addition, the ability to easily add "to do's" as the run is going on.

## Major Upcoming Battles to Prep
Major events: Asking the bot what major battle is up ahead and providing any links or images without spoiling future fights. (using the Embed feature) 

## Resetting Run
Exporting the data into a CSV for later and clearing out anydatabase. 

### More Difficult Projects 

    Type calculator: ex. Charizard: Weak to WAT, ELE, ROC x4
    Move questioniare
    Accessing some unbound specific API's
