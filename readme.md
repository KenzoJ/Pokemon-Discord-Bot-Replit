# Discord Bot for Pokemon Nuzlocke Runs

Purpose of this bot is for people who do pokemon runs in Unbound who want to track their many runs a bit more effeciently. This works best with a soul link run with multiple people and allows all members to use the bot. 

### Current Feature Pushes
- Improving speed of adding pokemon: drop down for IVs
- Picture for upcoming major fight
- List of battle items, then gives specific battle item description
- Learnable moves from a pokemon
- - Adding the ability to delete stored pokemon (using buttons)


A few initial ideas are below. I am open to any feedback or changes.

# Upcoming Features
## Tracking Pokemon and Exporting for Calc
- The user is able to add pokemon using discord slashes to output a Pokemon Unbound Calc ready format for easier calcing (http://unboundcalc.byethost3.com/?i=2)

## Cheat Requests
- Easier prompting for cheats: depending on the run, cheats are common to make for an easier experience. 
- You can give the bot the question to grab a specific item or TM/HM and it will spit out the code necessary.

#Doug Tasked
## Run Tracker
  The ability to give out a short, listed summary of what tasks are next. 
  In addition, the ability to easily add "to do's" as the run is going on.

## Resetting Run
Exporting the data into a CSV for later and clearing out anydatabase. 


### Major Upcoming Battles to Prep
Major events: Asking the bot what major battle is up ahead and providing any links or images without spoiling future fights. (using the Embed feature) 

### Potential Additions 

- Type calculator: Choosing a pokemon and out comes all their resistances and weaknesses. ex. Charizard: Weak to WAT, ELE, ROC x4
- Team Weakness: user adds their team and bot finds out what their team 

### Recent changelog:
- 02/16 Clean Up the adding pokemon feature to prevent errors in database
- 02/16 Now you can ask for either the item or the move based on the slash command
